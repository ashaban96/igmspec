We describe v02 of igmspec, a database of publically
available ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared spectra
that probe the intergalactic medium (IGM).  This database, a child
of the specdb repository in the specdb github organization,
comprises 403277 unique
sources and 434686 spectra obtained with the world's greatest
observatories.  All of these data are distributed in a single
~25 GB HDF5 file maintained at the University of
California Observatories and the University of California,
Santa Cruz.  The specdb software package includes
Python scripts and modules for searching the source catalog
and spectral datasets, and software links to the linetools
package for spectral analysis. The repository also includes software
to generate private spectral datasets that are compliant
with International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) protocols
and a Python-based interface for IVOA Simple Spectral Access queries.
Future versions of igmspec will ingest other sources
(e.g. gamma-ray burst afterglows) and other surveys as they become
publicly available. The overall goal is to include every
spectrum that effectively probes the IGM. Future databases of specdb
may include publicly available galaxy spectra
(exgalspec) and published supernovae spectra (snspec).
