# igmspec

Welcome to the igmspec repository.  The
igmspec database is intended to provide
all publicly available spectra that 
probe the intergalactic medium (IGM).
Parties interested in accessing and interfacing
with the database should see the primary 
publication: http://coming_to_arxiv.soon

This repository has two main purposes:

1.  Provide additional descriptions of the datasets 
ingested into the igmspec database.

1.  Maintain the software required to build the database.

It is unlikely that you will want or need to 
clone this repository.
