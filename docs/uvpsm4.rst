This document describes the UVpSM4 dataset.

Sources
=======


`Cooksey et al. (2010) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...708..868C>'_
complied the overwhelming majority of STIS and GHRS spectra on AGN obtained
prior to the SM4 mission (i.e. the installation of COS).  This yielded 69
sources.  They then processed any FUSE data associated with this sample.

All of these data are provided in igmspec.


Meta Data
=========

The meta data includes the reference for each spectrum
in "Ref".


Spectra
=======

All data were reduced with the standard HST pipelines.
Custom reductions of the FUSE spectra were performed.

The majority of spectra include a continuum.
