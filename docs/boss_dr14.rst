*****************
BOSS DR14 Dataset
*****************

This document describes the BOSS DR14 dataset in igmspec.

Sources
=======

The igmspec database v03 includes nearly all of the
quasar spectra corresponding to the quasars cataloged
by Paris et al. 2018, v4.4:
`DR14 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv171205029P>`_.

Meta Data
=========

The catalog includes a substantial set of meta data beyond the
required set for a specdb file.  See the paper for a full description.

Spectra
=======

In proceeding to download the spectra for the Paris et al. DR14
catalog, a small number were unavailable via the server.  Or, more
precisely, they have zero values.  This may eventually be corrected
but those data were not included in our v03 of igmspec.

Continua
========

There are no continua provided with DR14.  One may wish
to use the DR12 dataset provided in v02 of igmspec where
continua are provided for most of the spectra.
