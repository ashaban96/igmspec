COS-Dwarfs Dataset
******************

This document describes the COS-Dwarfs dataset.

Sources
=======

The COS-Dwarfs Survey
is a set of HST/COS
`Bordoloi et al. (2014) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...796..136B>`_
for the analysis of the circumgalactic medium of z~0 dwarf galaxies.
The quasars are a set of sources from the SDSS with
zem ~ 0.3 to 1. and bright in the FUV.


Meta Data
=========

There is little additional meta data.
Use `pyigm <http://https://github.com/pyigm/pyigm>`_
to access the measurements from the COS-Dwarfs survey.


Spectra
=======

The HST/COS spectra are wavelength and flux calibrated spectra using
CALCOS and then coadded with proprietary code
(see Tumlinson et al. 2013).
