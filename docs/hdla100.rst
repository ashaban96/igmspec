HDLA100 Dataset
***************

This document describes the HDLA100 dataset.

Sources
=======

The HIRES DLA 100 (HDLA100) dataset is the set of
echelle HIRES spectra published by
`Neeleman et al. (2013) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...769...54N>`_
for the analysis of z>2 DLA.
The quasars are a heterogenous set of sources useful
for such analysis (ie. bright).
Each sightline contains at least one DLA.


Meta Data
=========

The meta data provided with HDLA100 is very simple.
See pyigm for a complete set of published
measurements on the DLA.


Spectra
=======

The coadded, normalized HIRES spectra are provided.
