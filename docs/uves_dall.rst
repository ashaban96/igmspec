UVES_Dall Dataset
*****************

This document describes the UVES_Dall dataset.

Sources
=======

The UVES_Dall dataset is a compliation of quasars at z~3 generated
by `Dall'Aglio et al. (2008) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...491..465D>`_
for the analysis of the z~2.5 Lya forest.  These have been curated
by Michael Walther and Gabor Worseck (MPIA) and the ingested spectra
include continuum estimates.

Meta Data
=========

The only additional keyword is a Simbad-friendly name.

Note that for 4 of the sources:
HE2243-6031, HE1341-1020, Q0002-422, PKS2000-330
we have adopted the redshift listed in Dall'aglio et al.

Spectra
=======

The data are fluxed and an estimated continuum is provided.
