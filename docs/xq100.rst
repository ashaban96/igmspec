This document describes the XQ-100 dataset.

The XQ-100 survey is a Large Programme and public spectral data release of
100 quasars observed with the X-SHOOTER spectrometer on the VLT telescope.
The full Data Release became available in 2016, as described in
`Lopez et al. (2016)`.


Meta Data

The meta data provided with XQ-100 follows from Table A.3 of
Lopez et al (2016).  We refer the reader to that paper for
full details.


Spectra

In igmspec v2.0 are all of the spectra released in
XQ-100 except the 3-arm stitched products.  That is, each
spectrum is from an individual camera of X-SHOOTER.
