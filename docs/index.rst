Welcome to the igmspec documentation!
=====================================


igmspec is package for accessing spectra of sources useful
for probing the intergalactic medium (IGM).
The database is described in this
publication: http://coming_to_arxiv.soon

The igmspec repository enables the construction of the database
and also provides this documentaiton.
If you simply wish to download and use igmspec, you only need the software
in the `specdb <http://github.com/specdb/specdb>`_ repository.
