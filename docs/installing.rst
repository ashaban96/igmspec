Installing igmspec
******************

This document would have described how to install igmspec.

It is *very unlikely* that you wish to do this.
The *igmspec* software is only used
to build the database.   Odds are
that only JXP and a few others will
ever wish to do so.

As such, notes on dependencies have been scrubbed.
