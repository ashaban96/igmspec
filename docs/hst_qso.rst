This document describes the HSTQSO dataset.

\cite{ribaudo11} and \cite{neeleman+16}
`Ribaudo et al. (2011) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...736...42R>`_
and
`Neelman et al. (2016) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...818..113N>`_
compiled nearly the entire set of UV spectra of
quasars and AGN available in the HST archive
to survey for Lyman limit and damped Lya systems.
This includes the Faint Object Spectrometer dataset
compiled by
`Bechtold et al. (2002) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJS..140..143B>`_
and data from STIS
and COS (Lehner et al., in prep.).



Meta Data
=========

The meta data include alternate QSO names.
For the COS spectra, we include a combined G130M and G160M
where applicable and report the DATE-OBS of the G130M data.



Spectra
=======

All data were reduced with the standard HST pipelines.
The COS spectra were coadded with custom algorithms
(see Lehner et al., in prep).
