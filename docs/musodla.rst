MUSoDLA Dataset
***************

This document describes the MUSoDLA dataset.

Sources
=======

The Magellan uniform survey of damped Lya systems (MUSoDLA) sample is a set of
echelle and echellette spectra acquired by
`Jorgenson et al. (2013) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.435..482J>`_
for the analysis of z=2-4 DLAs.
The DLAs were selected to be at z>=2.2 from the SDSS DR5 sample in a uniform
random way towards quasars with i-band magnitudes <19 mag and declinations <+15 deg.

Meta Data
=========

The additional meta data provided better describe the
observation date of the spectra.


Spectra

The data are normalized.
